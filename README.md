# Block52 Whitepaper

## Abstract
Generation one block chains

## Private vs Public
The debate around private and public chains has been debated a lot.  Both use cases in my opinion are valid.  They're both tools for the job.  That said, when a currency is being created, the more "public" they are the better chance of success.

Private is the inverse, where fees and currency are not the uses case but the prohibitor.  We are looking at the transparency and redundancy properties of the chains, rather than the instrict values.

Third generation chains will facilitate the layer between them. 

## Domain specific chains
Some programming langauges are arguable better for specific domains.  Functional langauges such as Haskell and F# are used in the scientific commnuity.

Domain Speific chains will be the next interation of blockchains.  So what are domain specific chains?
