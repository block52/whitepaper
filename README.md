# Block52 Whitepaper

## Abstract
Block 52 is a domain specific blockchain with its own virtual machine tailored to faclicate and run card based games.  

## Private vs Public
The debate around private and public chains has been debated a lot.  Both use cases in my opinion are valid.  They're both tools for the job.  That said, when a currency is being created, the more "public" they are the better chance of success.

Private is the inverse, where fees and currency are not the uses case but the prohibitor.  We are looking at the transparency and redundancy properties of the chains, rather than the instrict values.

Third generation chains will facilitate the layer between them. 

## Domain specific block chains
Some programming langauges are arguable better for specific domains.  Functional langauges such as Haskell and F# are used in the scientific commnuity.  So what are domain specific chains?


## Layers

Block 52 has taken insperation off the lbry project.  lbry facilates the distribution of video conent through its network and allows users to share and pay for content with its native LBC token.
